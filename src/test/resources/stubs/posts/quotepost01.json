  "text": "The third category is the unlucky ones. After taking a museum-studies course they struggle to get any work at all. They take on more and more voluntary work, perhaps eventually getting a short-term contract post in, for example, documentation. They often end up in jobs they don’t really want because they’re the only ones available. When their first post comes to an end it takes them months to find anything else, and when they do it is often at a similar level. This continues for years, until they eventually are forced to give up on museum work and try a different sector, either because no more jobs are available, or because they have reached perhaps 30 years old, have not progressed and can see no prospect of earning a living wage in museums. In the worst cases, people effectively waste up to 10 years of their life failing to get a reasonable museum job and can become extremely upset, as shown by some of the comments recorded in appendix 2.",
